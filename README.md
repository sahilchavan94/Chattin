## Installation 

For running the app on your local systems, firsly clone this repository and after you need to install and configure flutter. 
Properly set the environment variable according to your operating systems to ensure Flutter is installed properly before you proceed. Be sure you have Android/IOS simulator to run the application.

If you are on Windows/Linux install Android Studio and install XCode if you are using Mac. Mac users can have both Android Studio and XCode.

After you are done you need to configure your own firebase project for flutter. You can use the flutterfire cli which will help you to do the process quicker. Don't use the same firebase project I have used here.

This project was a personal journey to deepen my understanding of clean architecture and state management. While I‚Äôm aware that the application is still a work in progress‚Äîlacking features like notifications and other enhancements to elevate the user experience‚Äîit has already taught me invaluable lessons.

I acknowledge there are issues related to scalability and security that need addressing. However, my primary goal with this project was to master state management, clean architecture, and Flutter UI concepts as well, and I‚Äôm pleased with the progress I‚Äôve made so far.

I‚Äôm always eager to learn and improve. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback on how I can make this app better, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Your input would be greatly appreciated!
